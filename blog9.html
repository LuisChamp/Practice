                <h2>Pets in tech</h2>
                <p>This feature showcases our most loyal pair programming furry friends!</p>
                <p>It has been proven that having a pet helps with your mental health.  They provide companionship and serve as a reminder to take a break, look away from the screen and be more active.  This is so important when you have been staring at the screen for hours - and will probably help you be more productive. 
                Send us a photo of your pet next to (or on!) your tech equipment by completing the form below.  Don't forget to let us know your pet's name and a fun fact about them. </p>
