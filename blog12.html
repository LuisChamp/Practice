        <p>HOW IT ALL STARTED</p>
        <h2>The Story Behind and the Process</h2>
        <p>It all started in 2013 when a good friend of mine introduced me to web development. We started learning HTML, and quickly after I got into CSS, at that point I was mind blown by it's power!</p>
        <p>A few months later, I created a <a href="#">Freelancer</a> account and started bidding on different jobs there. Some of the clients liked my work so I got myself few long-time gigs.</p>
        <p>I started learning jQuery to enhance my "web powers", but after a while, realizing that jQuery is built on top of JavaScript, I dropped it and started learning Vanilla JS, and when I felt that I understood what is going on under the hood, I picked ReactJS to help me on the long run on the front-end. I also added NodeJS (back-end) to my skills palette so I could provide Full-Stack JavaScript services. :)</p>
        <p>I later switched to <a>Upwork</a>  as they seem to care more about their freelancers.</p>
        <p>I also love creating tutorials on various topics ranging from: how to create different Web Components or Web Applications to how to solve Coding Challenges (mostly in JavaScript). You can find out more about these on my <a>blog</a>.</p>
