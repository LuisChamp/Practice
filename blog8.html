        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Passionate about getting everyone into Open Source</p>
        <img src="" alt="eddie-image">
        <div>
            <p>Eddie is an Open Source fullstack and DevRel expert, with experience in Javscript, Typescript, SQL, NoSQL, automation testing and DevOps. </p>
            <p>With clients ranging from UK Government departments, UK banks, global fintechs and startups, Eddie's experiences range from large corporate teams to small R&D teams. Eddie has had the opportunity to work with all disciplines in the tech industry; from developers, testers, UX/UI designers, technical writers, to product owners. </p>
            <p>Having had the opportunity to learn from so many great colleagues, Eddie has always believed in giving back to the tech community with particular focus on creating and supporting opportunities for those wanting to start a career in tech, through diversity and inclusion programmes. This started out by mentoring and delivering workshops in association with tech for good charities, to creating and building his own community,<a href="#">EddieHub</a>.</p>
            <p>The foundation of Eddie's tech ethos is Open Source, as there is something in it for everyone; not matter your role in the tech community you will find that you can become involved and learn from Open Source. Given there is no gatekeeping in Open Source, it fosters a real sense of collaboration, communication and career development. </p>
